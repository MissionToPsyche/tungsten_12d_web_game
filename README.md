 # 2024 NASA Psyche 12-D Tungsten Class

This project is a collaborative effort by students from Arizona State University to develop a system for NASA's Psyche mission.

## Team Members: 

Jace Kocsis, Harikrishna Kommineni, Cole Krause, Pei-En Pan, & Dylan A Wynne

## Project Description: 

The development of a game where they begin their adventure in Marsâ€™s orbit where players are tasked with piloting their spaceship to the surrounding asteroids. Once reaching an asteroid, the player will unlock research points that can later be used to unlock five upgrades including communications, propulsion, radar, rover, and materials. These upgrades enhance the ship's systems, enhancing the gameplay for the player. When a player unlocks an upgrade, they will also unlock a fun fact regarding either the respective system or general fact of the Psyche mission. Tying these two components together encourages the player to advance further in the game. 

## Frameworks, IDE, Programming languages, a library used in the project:

C#, Unity

## Known issues:

Restarting the game via going back to the main menu disables HoverTips
